Hello,

I offer about a decade of back end SQL and ancillary automation work across a handful of scripting languages.  My clients have included a broad range of companies from 20 person startups to some of the largest corporations.  

I've got specific experience using python and django to datamine and repurpose the edgar online SEC filings.

Recently (as in the last two years) I've focussed my efforts exclusively to orienting my skillset to a node.js/javascript/microservices platform as an alternative to the traditional big SQL database with ETL setup.

If you'd like to talk,  feel free to contact me directly or forward my information.

Best Regards,

Cole
