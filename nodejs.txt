I'm currently on assignment setting up MySQL -> graphql -> relay -> react
on Koa2.  GraphQL is set up, relay is still challenging after 2 days.

past node projects:
https://github.com/colealbon/price-downloader-ticker-react (react model)
https://github.com/colealbon/blocktool (almost a good koa microservice example)
https://github.com/colealbon/streamliner (PGP key exchange)

All of this is back end or very rudimentary HTML5 front end.
