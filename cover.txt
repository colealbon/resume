Hello,

I offer to you my availability for a front end role.  I am experienced but rusty on the C#/Microsoft side, but I'm current with modern React and solidjs platforms.  I live on a boat in Emeryville, and sail competitively.  I would expect a good cultural fit with the sports minded Bay Area tennis crowd. 

Thanks! 

Cole
